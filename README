Executable file is stored within dist folder called app.exe.

This application is a preliminary version for a POS(point-of-sales) system which will provide visual representation and tools to create shapes that represent tables in a restaurant. The implemented functions are: 'Draw', 'Resize', 'Move', 'Update', 'Delete' and 'Database'. ***All the below functions are touch-screen friendly*** 
The 'draw' function allows the user to click and hold the mouse left-click to determine its size and location. A 'save' button is implemented to save the drawn shape and insert that into the database. 
The 'resize' function allows the user to click and drag any existing table to a desired size, then updates that data into the database. 
The 'move' function allows the user to move any existing table to a desired location and updates new data to the database. 
The 'update' function allows the user to click on a table which will open a new window and allow for more data inputs regarding the specified table (eg. a table id).
The 'delete' function allows the user to click on a table and delete it using the 'confirm' button. This will remove it from the database as well.
The 'database' function is a page that display the current amount of tables in the database and displays each table and their corresponding data currently stored within the database.

Information before running application:
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Relevant Files: app.py, database_accessor.py, db_data_return.py and shortcuts.py

This application was made using Python 3.7.
Python Libraries required: tkinter 8.6, mysql.connector 8.0.16 
Note: This application will only run with a running database with the settings described below

mySQL Version: 8.0
A user for the database will need to be created.
This application requires a premade database with the settings set as:
	
	Host: localhost
	Database Name: test1 
	User: ______
	Password:_______
	
	The above can be altered to preference in the code. It is contained in file database_accessor.py and database_data_return.py.

	A table must be created with the name 'Setup' but name can be changed as long as the respective code is changed in database_accessor.py and database_data_return.py.

	Within the table 'Setup' it must contain fields:

	1.	Name - int unsigned - not null - auto_increment - Primary Key
	2.	Id - char - null
	3.	Split - char - null - default = 'No'
	4.	Shape - char - null
	5.	x1 - int - null
	6.	y1 - int - null
	7.	x2 - int - null
	8.	y2 - int - null
	9.	Occupancy - char - null - default = 'No'
	10.	Max_Seating - int unsigned - null
	11.	Current_Seated - int unsigned - null - default = 0

	Any alterations to the above should be cross-checked with database_accessor.py, database_data_return.py and app.py.
